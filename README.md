Type
1.build a class Genre(model)
2.GenreDao interface with crud + getAll() methods
3.implementation class

4 we implement: the getAll() method
5 we implement: the getGenereById(codeG) method
6 we implement: the insert(genre) method
7 we implement: the update(genre) method
8 we implement: the delete(type) method

Main java class: TestType:

a .we call method 4: we print the list of genres present on Db
b .we call method 5: we print the data of the requested type
c .we call method 6: we print the result of the insertion and print the list
d .we call method 7: we print the outcome of the update (e.g. change the description of novels to novels) we print the list
and .we call method 8: we print the result of the delete and print the list

publisher
1.build a Publisher(model) class
2. EditoreDao interface with crud + getAll() methods
3.implementation class

4 we implement: the getAll() method
5 I implement: the getEditoreById(codeE) method
6 we implement: the insert(Editor) method
7 we implement: the update(Editor) method
8 we implement: the delete(Editor) method

Main java class: TestEditor:

a .we call method 4: we print the list of Publishers present on Db
